We do not provide individual support via email ‚Äî **public discussion benefits everyone**.

### When Reporting an Issue

* **Describe the issue clearly:** What exactly is going wrong? Are you seeing an error? Is a feature misbehaving? ‚ÄúX doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù is not enough ‚Äî please include steps to reproduce.
* **Include relevant code:** If applicable, share only the relevant parts. Avoid pasting full scripts unless necessary.
* **Use collapsible blocks for long code/logs:** Wrap long logs or tracebacks in `<details>` tags to keep issues readable.
  Example:

  ````markdown
  <details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  ```log
  Error: Agent not found
  at SmartManagerAgent.run(...)
  ````

  </details>
